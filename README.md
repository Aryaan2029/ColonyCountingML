## Introduction


The traditional and preferred method for quantifying microbe populations is by colony enumeration. This process involves serially diluting liquefied samples, plating the samples on media plates, and counting the resulting colony-forming units. Assuming each colony-forming unit originates from a single microbe, the number of microbes can then be back-calculated (1).  Research technicians typically count the number of colonies by hand, which can number up towards hundreds on a plate. The task of counting is tedious and prone to error (2). To reduce this burden, we aim to develop a program to digitally enumerate the number of colony-forming units using images of the sampled media plates.
